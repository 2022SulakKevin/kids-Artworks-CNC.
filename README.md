# CNC Controller App

A cross-platform Flutter application that streams G-code over Wi-Fi/WebSocket to an Arduino-controlled CNC drawing machine.  
Built for the **Kids Artworks Drawing Machine** project to provide a safe, hands-free artistic workflow.

---

## ✨ Features

* Live whiteboard: draw free-hand, shapes, or paste clipboard text  
* Real-time WebSocket transmission of G-code to GRBL firmware  
* TensorFlow Lite sketch-completion suggestions (optional)  
* Clipboard integration for quick G-code tweaks  
* Material-design UI, dark-mode ready

## 🚀 Getting started

1. **Clone the repo**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-user>/cnc_controller.git
   cd cnc_controller
````

2. **Install Flutter & Dart SDK**

   Follow [https://docs.flutter.dev/](https://docs.flutter.dev/) and ensure `flutter doctor` shows no errors.

3. **Fetch packages**

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

4. **Run on an emulator / device**

   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

The app should launch, connect to your CNC’s WebSocket endpoint (default `ws://192.168.4.1:80`—edit in `main.dart`), and mirror all strokes as G-code.
